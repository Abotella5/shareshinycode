### Instructions

Defined overweight and obesity as an excess of body fat, the measure most used for diagnose them is the Body Mass Index (BMI). But, this measure underestimates the prevalence of overweight and obesity. It has been suggested that the Body Fat Percentage (BFP) is most util indicator to estimate the overweight and obesity, and thereby, prevent the health risk associated.

This application calculate the BMI (weight and height based) and the estimated BFP (BMI, gender and age based), and plotting each in a nutritional category graphic.

On the left panel, put your age, select your gender, type your height in meters and select your weight with the slider (click on the button and slide it). 

If you click on the *Results* section, on the right panel, the application show you the BMI and the BFP calculated. The red line in the graphics indicate the BMI (upper graphic) and the BFP (lower graphic), place them on the appropriate nutritional category.

If your nutritional category isn't *Normal weight*, you can slide the weight slider until the red line is situe on the *Normal weight* category and you see your *ideal weight* in both BMI and BFP nutritional category classifications. And you can appreciate the differences.

Of course, you can change the *age*, *height* and *gender* too and the red line change the position, but change your age, height or gender in the real life is difficult.

The BMI nutritional category has been obtained from [WHO-Europe nutritional page web](http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/nutrition/a-healthy-lifestyle/body-mass-index-bmi).
